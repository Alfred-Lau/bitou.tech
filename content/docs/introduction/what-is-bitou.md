我来支持更丰富的渲染形式

> Bitou is GitLab/GitHub for Database, built for team collaboration.

As GitLab/GitHub provides a GUI and collaboration workspace for teams to manage code, Bitou does the similar job for managing database.
This is the **most significant difference from all existing schema migration, SQL client tools**.

Bitou complements the existing cloud provider's database platforms or the company's internal database operation platforms. While those platforms take care of the database instance level operations (e.g. provisioning a database instance), Bitou helps teams to use the provisioned database to build their application.

## Key Features

### [Database CI/CD and Change Automation](/docs/change-database/change-workflow/)

Like code review, Bitou streamlines the database change process. Within a single workflow, a database change can be reviewed and deployed from the dev environment all the way to the production environment.

### [Data Rollback and Disaster Recovery](/docs/change-database/rollback-data-changes/)

- Statement-level rollback

## Comparison

### Database Change Management

If Liquibase, Flyway are Git, then Bitou is GitLab/GitHub. And as an open source project. Bitou
is growing way faster.
